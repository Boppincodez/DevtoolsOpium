          <h1>Destroy Lonely +**</h1>

          Bobby Wardell Sandimanie III was born on July 30, 2001. He has two
          younger sisters and an older brother which he mentions as only being
          half-siblings. He mentions feeling more like an only child. He grew up
          freestyling with inspiration from his father, rapper I-20. He began
          home school in the sixth grade with given permission from his
          grandmother who was a former teacher. He enrolled back in school in
          the ninth and tenth grades where he recalls abusing the drug Xanax. He
          cites his feeling that his substance abuse was destroying him as the
          origin of the "Destroy" part of his stage name. He spent his
          adolescent years in solitude which he cites as the origin of the
          "Lonely" part of his stage name. During his time in school, he had
          strength in writing.
